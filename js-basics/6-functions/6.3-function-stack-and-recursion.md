## JS Basics (Part VI - cont.)

### Function stack 
- also known as a <em>call stack</em>; it's basically a mechanism that is used browsers to be able to keep track it's place in a program that calls multiple functions 
- click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack) to see how a call stack is created, maintained, and develops over time.

### Recursion 
- the act of a function calling itself over and over again is called <em>recursion</em>
- a function that calls itself is called a <em>recursive function</em>
- there are three features of recursion:
  1. A termination condition: this condition is in charge of stopping the recursion in the case of an invalid input; different from a <em>base case</em> because this can happen without our condition being met and the point of this is to catch bad data 
  2. a base case: <em>ends</em> the recursion, as in a condition has been fulfilled/met and therefore, the process of recursion need not continue any more. It is the goal of our recursive function and is usually written as an **if ...** conditional
  3. the recursion: this is the line(s) of code where the function is calling itself  
  - recursive functions are very similar to loops in the sense that the function will keep calling itself until the base case (condition) is met. 
- Recursion can be used in cases where:
  - you have to increase or decrease a value over and over again but you don't know how many times the recursion should happen (if you did know how many times, you could have just used a `for ...` loop).
    - One may argue that the a `while ...` loops could be used in cases where you don't know how many times the recursion should take place but one of the most important things to understand here is that recursion and iteration execute and end differently (more on this later)
  - a problem can be broken down into smaller problems and the solution of the overall problem relies on the solutions of the smaller problem -- this is simply too complex to solve with a loop so a recursive function is preferred in this case.
- Example problem: Write a function that calculates the factorial of any given number.
  ```
  /*
  A factorial is the product of all the positive integers less then of equal n, a given number.
  For instance, 3! = 3 * 2 * 1, where the process of multiplying all the positive numbers less than n takes place until the number is 1. This is going to be our base case, the case that ends our recursive function.

  - Termination condition: if (num < 0) { return 'Invalid factorial' }
  - Base case = num should be >= 1; if it's 1, then function should return 1
  
  */ 
  // Solution: (click [here](https://repl.it/@aksharasun/Factorial-Function) to view in action) 

  function factorial(num) {
    let factors = num - 1;
    if (num < 0) {
      return 'Invalid factorial'
    } else if (num === 1) {
      return 1
    } else 
    return num * factorial(factors)
  }
  
  ```
