## JS Basics (Part VI - cont.)

### What is scope?
- Scope in JS refers to the accessiibility/visibility of elements, which all depends on where these elements are defined.  
- <em>Function scope</em> refers to not only where the function is defined, but also what other elements the function has access to, AND whether the function itself is accessible by other elements. Here are a few rules of accessbility: 
  - Variables that are defined inside of a function cannot be accessed anywhere outside of the function.
  - A function can access variables that are defined in the same scope as itself.
    - For instance: 
      - A function defined in the global scope can access all variables that are also defined in this scope. 
      - A function defined inside of a function can access all the variables that the parent function has access to and also what is inside of the parent function.
