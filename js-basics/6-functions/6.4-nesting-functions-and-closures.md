## JS Basics (Part VI - cont.)

## Nesting Functions
- nested functions are functions that are within another function (different from recursion because a recursive function calls <em>itself</em> whereas nested functions are functions that different from the one containing it)
  - the nested function is private only to the function that contains it and therefore, cannot be accessed by anything outside of the parent function 
## Closures
- closures give you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function; this is when the inner function inherits the parent function's arguments and variables
  - nested functions are closures 
- it's important to note that even though the inner function has access to the outer function's scope, the outer function cannot access the inner function's scope
- Uses:
  ```
  function parent (arg1, arg2) {
    function child(num) {
      return num * num
    }
    return child(arg1) - child(arg2)
  }
  ```
  - in the above example, the function `child()` is called inside function `parent()`. When the `parent()` function is called, the `child()` function will also execute so it is safe to assume that when you call the `parent()` function, you'll be able to specify for both the functions. For instance:
  ```
  parent(9, 8); // returns 17
  ```
